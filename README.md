# dotfiles

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/dlampsi/dotfiles/workflows/checks/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dlampsi/dotfiles/actions)

Yet another dotfiles repo.

## Getting started

This repo contains my personal dotfiles for various tools that I use on a daily basis. The setup script will create symlinks to the dotfiles in the home directory and optionally creates a backup of the existing files.

## Setup

Clone this repo and run setup script to provision symlinks to the dotfiles:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

See all available tool options:
```bash
./setup.sh -h
```
